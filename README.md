Algorithms HW5
1. The minimum would be 2^h and the maximum would be 2^(h+1) - 1

2. Yes, for example a sorted array [2, 5, 16, 18, 25] would look like <show tree> Min - Heap has the smallest number in the root node and all parents are smaller than their children

3. <show tree> this array is not max-heap, A[4] is smaller than it's child A[9]

4 - 8 do at home
